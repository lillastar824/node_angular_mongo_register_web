  <p>Commission % is percentage which @ company want to give to developers
    <br><br>
    As a developer, you’re eligible to receive a <b>commission</b> when you refer someone to purchase an @sign. <br><br>

To encourage others to buy an @sign, you can set a <b>percent discount</b> for anyone who uses your @sign as a promotion code. This is the percentage used to calculate the received discount.
<br><br>
You can also set a <b>max discount</b>, which indicates the maximum cash value you want to offer as a discount. If the percent discount exceeds the max discount you have set, then the purchaser will receive the max discount instead of the percent discount. If the max discount is set to 0, then the purchaser will receive the full percent discount.
<br><br>
**Note that the discount value will be deducted from your total commission, which is calculated using the full price, not the discount price, of the purchased @sign.
<br><br>
For example, let’s suppose that you receive a 20% commission from The @ Company. You set your percent discount to 10% and your max discount to 0. 
<br><br>
If someone uses your @sign as a promotion code to buy an @sign for $1000, they will receive a discount of $100. This amount will be subtracted from your total commission of $200, which is 20% of $1000. In total, you will receive $100. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, if you choose to set your max discount to $20, the person buying the $1000 @sign will receive a $20 discount. This amount will be subtracted from your total commission of $200, so you will receive $180 in total.
