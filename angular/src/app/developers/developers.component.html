                    The most tedious part of building an app is the user/data management, it can also be the most
                    expensive to host due to the higher cost of database servers and backups. By developing on the @
                    protocol you remove all that work.
                    <br>
                    By developing on the protocol and allowing people to own their own data, your product will also
                    automatically comply with the GDPR and CCPA, as well as a host of other privacy legislation that is
                    in the works.

                    <br>
                    It gets even better, you can make money when your customers sign up for a custom @sign.
